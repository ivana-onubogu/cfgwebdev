            <p>Welcome to the About Me page, inspired by the luvvacation visible in the first image of my Roots gallery. In the front matter of Arthur Pfister's poetry collection, <i>Beer Cans, Bullets, Things & Pieces</i>, he describes a dedication that is actually a 'liv' or 'luv'-ication, because he rejects the phonetic sound of 'dead' that begins dedication. I loved that/it struck me and so I'm borrowing it here.</p>
            <p>You can find a series of photos that I feel best represents me, my values and my interests. This is a living gallery; you can hover over images to get a short description and you can expect that more images will populate over time.</p>

                <h2>Nigerian fufu</h2>
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BdSYnfTT9M&t=524s"><img src="https://assets.epicurious.com/photos/5e2f6334b1633d0009d08cc4/4:3/w_3816,h_2862,c_limit/EgusiStew_HERO_011620_243.jpg" alt="A photo of Nigerian pounded yam, or fufu."></a>
                <center><p>Nigerian fufu is a traditional dish that usually features a hand-pounded starch (such as yam or cassava) and an accompanying stew. Pictured above you'll see my favorite combination: pounded yam and egusi stew. Growing up, this was eaten both for regular dinners/lunches and at special events. If you click on the image, you can watch a video of it being made. When I was younger, I enjoyed bitterleaf stew the most; though I still enjoy it, egusi has risen to the top two spots (and it ain't two!). I hope that if you haven't tried, you could add it to to your food bucket list.</p></center>

                <h2>Southern fried catfish</h2>
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33sHtnm3gVs"><img src="https://insanelygoodrecipes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Fried-Catfish-1024x536.png" alt="A photo of fried catfish."></a>
                <center><p>Southern fried catfish is exactly what it sounds like, although perfecting it is maybe not so easy to discern. If you click on the image you can watch a video and give it a try yourself. While both my parents are Nigerian, I have only ever lived here in America and understand my cultural to be as 'truly' African-American as it is Nigerian. So, fried catfish has got to be that favorite cultural dish of mine. As a kid, it was hanging out with friends that put me on. I haven't looked back since.</p></center>
